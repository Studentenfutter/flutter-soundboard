A simple soundboard app, with:

 - Quotes laid out as a scrollable grid of captioned image tiles. Tapping on one plays the sound bite.
 - A search bar, allowing quotes to be filtered by their content and by other metadata such as the TV show they're from
 - 'Play random' floating action button, which will play a random quote of those returned by the current search
 - Ability to share a quote (e.g. to WhatsApp) by long-pressing on it
 
## Data entry:

If you want to fork this project to make your own custom list of quotes, then you'll need:

 - Some audio clips that you want to play
 - Images for the clips. 
     - At least one per 'source' of audio, but can add more if you want more granularity than that 
     - Must be square, at least 200x200 pixels in size and in PNG format.
